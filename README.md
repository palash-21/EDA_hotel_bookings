# EDA_hotel_bookings
We have a data set that contains booking information for city and resort hotels, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies and the number of available parking spaces among other things.
Our task is to provide insights into the data and discover important factors that govern the bookings.
With the help of our analysis, we will be able to answer all such questions that would help visitors plan a better experience as well as hotel management in making strategic plans to improve their services and boost their business.
